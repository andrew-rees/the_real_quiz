Remove used questions from random using 'used' - using JS seems bad, why not use local storage (add question_id to there, if it's there, try again)
register if correct answer used and store in session.
-- for the question, you know the right answer (corrrect_answer_id)
-- if the answer_id == question.correct_answer_id, return 
position elements
end quiz button
-- clears storage
